## Inspiration

We thought about the problems facing our community and the world, and realized that declining physical and mental health due to a lack of exercise was one of the biggest issues facing people today. We decided to build a way to make exercise interesting.

## What it does

The StepUp app for Android encourages people to get moving by including daily and long-term goals for step counts while also having game elements to keep things interesting. With motivation from the at-times moody koala coach Walkabout, users walk to collect Koala Coins to purchase fun prizes.
How we built it
